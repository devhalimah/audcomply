Lightweight Compliance Tracker

Preparing for internal compliance audits is often time-consuming and disorganized, especially for small teams without enterprise tools. LiteComply solves this by offering a free, browser-based mini assistant for tracking audit procedures, assigning responsibilities, and monitoring progress.

Built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, it provides a simple dashboard, customizable checklists, and local reminders that keep tasks on track. AudComply demonstrates how automation can enhance audit readiness and process transparency, even in low-resource environments.
